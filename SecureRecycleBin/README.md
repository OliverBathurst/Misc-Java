# SecureRecycleBin
A secure alternative to the recycle bin, encrypts using AES and then deletes files permanently.
The JAR file must be kept with the .exe file for proper operation. Simply drag and drop files onto 
the executable to permanently and securely delete them. For ease of use, create a shortcut to the executable 
on the desktop and drag and drop onto that instead. Also recommend trying to add the secure cleaner to the
right click context menu, tutorials are available online.

How to add to the "Send To" context menu:
1. Run "shell:sendto" from the run dialog
2. Add a shortcut to the executable to that folder

You need Java installed
